# Reading-list

This is a small effort to list down the resources that I liked while learning a specific technology. 

I like going through authorative/bible-style documentation and books while learning. Finding that gem takes a bit of time, but I often lose track of those perfect books/links when I want to go through them again or suggest to my friends.

In short, this is a highly opinionated list of resources that I would be happy to pay for any day.

### HTML & CSS

1. [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189)

This is a beautiful visual book (with a generic title) and great for anyone to get started. If you felt that html is dull, this should change that.

It is not a reference book, hence weak on the details.
