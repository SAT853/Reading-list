# Reading-list

This is a small effort to list down the resources that I liked while learning a specific technology. 

I like going through authorative/bible-style documentation and books while learning. Finding that gem takes a bit of time, but I often lose track of those perfect books/links when I want to go through them again or suggest to my friends.

In short, this is a highly opinionated list of resources that I would be happy to pay for any day.

### HTML & CSS

1. [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189) ****

    This is a beautiful visual book (with a generic title) and great for anyone to get started. If you feel that html is dull, this should change that. It is indispensable for beginners, worth a skim for intermediates and experts.

    It is not a reference book, hence weak on the details.

2. [HTML & CSS: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition](https://www.amazon.in/HTML-CSS-Complete-Reference-Fifth/dp/0070701946) **

    In my opinion, you don't really need to deep dive into html - mostly because all the magic is really in CSS. But if you still want to, this can be your reference book on HTML (ignore css section of the book). 

    **Beware** - it is a pretty outdated book, filled with older way of doing things - so you need to know what you are looking for.

3. Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer *****

    This is the most awesome book on CSS. It is a hardcore, specification-for-masses kind of book. It explains every detailed mathematical calculation that goes into deciding what to render/show from the css properties we provide. If you feel like css properties are just a few knobs that you turn until things look right, then this will teach you what turning those knobs really do and in effect, which ones to actually turn.

    If not anything, you'll learn to appreciate the complexity behind css. It is a must read for everyone, but some people might be turned off by its dryness.

    The author, Eric Meyer himself worked on css specifications - his [blog](https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/) and all of his books are worth a read. 4th edition of this book comes as a full book as well as many Chapterwise mini-books - printed books are hardly available in India, its better to go for a digital ebook on this one.
